### Show(Info to others)

### Info

This is only shown if the option `Display ID in sheet caption` is enabled in Sheet Options in [Settings](sandbox_settings.md)
It is only shown to GMs.

When clicked, it will output the item/actors data to the Console(press F12).

For actors, CTRL+Click will display the Actor Properties Manager for that actor

## Actor Properties Manager

The Actor Properties manager is a useful tool to remove obsolete properties and otherwise troubleshoot actor properties problems.
